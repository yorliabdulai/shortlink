ShortLink URL Shortening Service
A lightweight, production-ready URL shortening service built with raw PHP and MySQL, featuring /encode and /decode API endpoints to shorten and retrieve URLs. The service uses a custom database class and a base-62 hashing algorithm to generate unique, short URLs.
Features

Encode Endpoint: Converts long URLs (e.g., https://sommalife.com/impact/) to short URLs (e.g., http://shrt.est/ZeAK).
Decode Endpoint: Retrieves the original URL from a short URL.
Custom Database Class: Uses PDO for secure MySQL interactions without third-party libraries.
Object-Oriented Design: Modular and maintainable codebase.
Postman Collection: Includes tests for API endpoints.
